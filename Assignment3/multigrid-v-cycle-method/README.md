# Multigrid V-cycle Method

This project is part of the course 'Numerical Methods for Partial Differential Equations' I took last semester.
This code solves a specific 2D Poission equation using geometric Multigrid V-cycle method with damped-Jacobi as smoother.
The code can easly be modified to solve any 2D Poission problem, just change the boundary conditions and 'exact_sol' lambda to fit your problem.
